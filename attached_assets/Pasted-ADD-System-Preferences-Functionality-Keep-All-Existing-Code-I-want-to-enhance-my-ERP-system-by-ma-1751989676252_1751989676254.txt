ADD System Preferences Functionality - Keep All Existing Code

I want to enhance my ERP system by making the System Preferences page fully functional. Currently it's just a placeholder. Please ADD the following features WITHOUT removing or breaking any existing functionality:

BACKEND - Add these NEW APIs to server/index.ts (don't modify existing APIs):

1. GET /api/system-preferences - Fetch all system settings
2. PUT /api/system-preferences/:key - Update individual settings
3. GET /api/company-info - Get company details
4. PUT /api/company-info - Update company information
5. GET /api/email-settings - Get SMTP configuration
6. PUT /api/email-settings - Update email settings
7. POST /api/test-email - Send test email
8. GET /api/backup-settings - Get backup configuration
9. PUT /api/backup-settings - Update backup settings
10. POST /api/create-backup - Create manual backup

DATABASE - Add system preferences initialization:
- Create default system preferences in the database
- Company info (name, address, phone, email, tax ID)
- Email settings (SMTP host, port, username, encryption)
- Security settings (session timeout, password requirements)
- Backup settings (frequency, location, retention)
- Notification preferences (alerts, thresholds)
- General settings (language, timezone, date format)

FRONTEND - Enhance SystemPreferences.tsx:
- Add 6 working tabs: Company, Email, Security, Backup, Notifications, General
- Each tab should have forms that connect to the backend APIs
- Add form validation and real-time saving
- Include "Test Email" button that actually works
- Add "Create Backup" button with progress indicator
- Show success/error toast messages
- Use React Hook Form for form management
- Add loading states during API calls

SPECIFIC FEATURES:
- Company tab: Business information form with save functionality
- Email tab: SMTP configuration with test email feature
- Security tab: Password policies and session settings
- Backup tab: Automated backup settings + manual backup creation
- Notifications tab: Alert preferences and thresholds
- General tab: Language, timezone, date format selection

REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep ALL existing code and functionality intact
- Only ADD new features, don't modify existing routes or components
- Ensure all tabs are clickable and functional
- Make forms actually save data to database
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Use existing UI components (shadcn/ui) for consistency

The goal is to transform System Preferences from a placeholder into a fully working admin panel while preserving everything else that's already working.

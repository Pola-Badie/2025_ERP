# Premier ERP System - Deployment Guide

## SSL Certificate Issue Resolution

The Let's Encrypt certificate acquisition failed because:
- Domain `demo.premiererp.io` isn't pointing to your server
- DNS records need to be configured first
- Let's Encrypt requires domain validation

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Local Deployment (Recommended for Testing)
Use self-signed certificates for immediate deployment:

```bash
sudo ./docker-deploy-local.sh
```

**Access:** https://localhost (ignore browser certificate warning)

### Option 2: Production with Valid Domain
1. Configure DNS: Point demo.premiererp.io to your server IP
2. Wait for DNS propagation (24-48 hours)
3. Run production deployment:

```bash
sudo ./docker-deploy-simple.sh
```

### Option 3: Different Domain
Update deployment scripts to use your actual domain:

```bash
# Edit the domain in deployment scripts
sed -i 's/demo.premiererp.io/yourdomain.com/g' docker-deploy-simple.sh nginx-production.conf
sudo ./docker-deploy-simple.sh
```

## Current Status
- Backend API: Functional at localhost:5000
- Database: PostgreSQL ready
- Frontend: React application built
- SSL: Self-signed certificates available

## Next Steps
1. Use local deployment for immediate testing
2. Configure proper DNS for production domain
3. Run production deployment once DNS is active

The system is fully functional - only SSL certificate acquisition needs proper domain configuration.
